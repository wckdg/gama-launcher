1. Enable server generation:
   /dh config generation.mode INTERNAL_SERVER

2. Check current config:
   /dh config generation.mode
   Should show: INTERNAL_SERVER ✅

3. Pre-generate spawn area:
   /dh pregen start minecraft:overworld 0 0 250
   
   What this does:
   → Generates LODs in 250 chunk radius (4000 blocks)
   → Takes 30-40 minutes
   → All players get LODs immediately!

4. Check progress:
   /dh pregen status
   
   Shows:
   → Percentage complete
   → Estimated time remaining
   → Chunks processed

5. When done:
   Server has LODs ready! ✅



Use Chunky to pre-generate larger area:

/chunky world minecraft:overworld
/chunky center 0 0
/chunky radius 750
/chunky start

This generates:
→ 750 chunk radius = 12,000 blocks
→ Takes 40-60 minutes with C2ME
→ BlueMap will show full map ✅

After Chunky finishes:
/bluemap reload
or
/bluemap update

BlueMap re-renders and looks complete! ✨
